# reveal.js template

This is a customised template used to get the ball rolling on reveal.js
presentations as quickly as possible. It's a stripped down version of the full
reveal.js presentation framework including only the `.css` themes I use (`night`
and `simple`).

Crucially it also includes an `index.html` containing all necessary boilerplate
I need for easily getting presentations looking how I like them.

## Plugins

The following commonly used plugins are included and already included as
dependencies in `index.html`:
